# 🧠 Task 01 – Writing Better Prompts

### Internship: SkillCraft Technology  
### Student: [Komanpally Abhigna]  
### Branch: Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE)  

---

## 🎯 Objective
Learn the basics of **prompt engineering** by experimenting with clarity, specificity, and tone.

You’ll take **three vague or ineffective prompts** and rewrite them into improved versions.  
Then compare and analyze the outputs to understand how **prompt design** affects LLM behavior.

## 🧩 Task Steps

### Step 1: Choose 3 vague prompts
Examples:
1. “Explain climate change.”
2. “Tell me about AI.”
3. “Write something about space.”

### Step 2: Rewrite them into better prompts
| Original Prompt             |   Improved Prompt                                                                       |
|---------------------------- |-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Explain climate change      | Explain climate change in 3 bullet points for a 12-year-old student.                    |
| Tell me about AI            | Summarize what Artificial Intelligence is and give two real-life examples in 100 words. |
| Write something about space | Describe the solar system as if you are explaining it to a beginner.                    |

### Step 3: Test and Compare
Use ChatGPT (or another LLM) to run both versions and observe differences in clarity, tone, and detail.

---

## 🧠 Analysis
Write a short reflection:
- What differences did you notice between vague and specific prompts?
- How did specificity or audience targeting affect the response?
- What did you learn about clarity and structure?

---

## ✅ Outcome
After this exercise, you’ll understand how prompt phrasing directly influences output quality and tone.
